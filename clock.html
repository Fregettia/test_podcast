 I was trying to say was that it is better to be bad of one’s own free 
will than to be good through scientific brainwashing. When Alex has the 
power of choice, he chooses only violence. But, as his love of music 
shows, there are other areas of choice. In the British edition of the 
book—though not in the American, nor in the film—there is an epilogue 
that shows Alex growing up, learning distaste for his old way of life, 
thinking of love as more than a mode of violence, even foreseeing 
himself as a husband and father. The way has always been open; at last 
he chooses to take it. He has been a sour orange; now he is filling with
 something like decent human sweetness.</p><p>Is freedom of choice 
really all that important? For that matter, is man capable of it? Again,
 does the term “freedom” have any intrinsic meaning? These are questions
 I must ask and attempt to answer. For the moment, I have to record that
 I have been derided and rebuked for expressing my fears of the power of
 the modern state—whether it be Russia, China, or what we may term 
Anglo-America—to reduce the freedom of the individual. Literature has 
warned of this power, books like Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World” and 
George Orwell’s “1984,” but “sensible” people, not much moved by 
imaginative writing, are always telling us that we have little to worry 
about. Indeed, B. F. Skinner’s book “Beyond Freedom and Dignity” came 
out at the very time that “A Clockwork Orange” first appeared on the 
screen, ready to demonstrate the advantages of what we may call 
beneficent brainwashing. Our world is in a bad way, says Skinner, what 
with the problems of war, pollution of the environment, civil violence, 
the population explosion. Human behavior must change—that much, he says,
 is self-evident, and few would disagree—and in order to do this we need
 a technology of human behavior. We can leave out of account the inner 
man, the man we meet when we debate with ourselves, the hidden being 
concerned with God and the soul and ultimate reality. We must view man 
from the outside, considering particularly what makes one item of human 
behavior move on to another. The behaviorist approach to man, of which 
Professor Skinner is a great exponent, sees him moved to various kinds 
of action by aversive and non-aversive inducements. Fear of the whip 
drove the slave to work; fear of dismissal still drives the wage-slave 
to work. It is such negative reinforcements to action that Professor 
Skinner condemns; what he wants to see more of is positive 
reinforcements. You teach a circus animal tricks not by cruelty but by 
kindness. (Skinner should know: much of his experimental work has been 
with animals; some of his achievements in animal conditioning approach a
 high professional circus level.) Given the right positive 
inducements—to which we respond not rationally but through our 
conditioned instincts—we shall all become better citizens, submissive to
 a state that has the good of the community at heart. We must, so the 
argument goes, not fear conditioning. We need to be conditioned in order
 to save the environment and the race. But it must be conditioning of 
the right sort.</p><p>It is, in the Skinnerian argument, conditioning of
 the wrong sort that turns the hero of “A Clockwork Orange” into a 
vomiting paragon of non-aggression. That I myself consider any kind of 
conditioning wrong must be accounted, I suppose, to the strength of the 
religious tradition in which I was reared. I have, so to speak, been 
conditioned by it, but my reason approved the convictions that I feel in
 my very gut. My family comes from Lancashire, that northern county 
which used to be a stronghold of the Catholic faith. The Protestant 
Reformation, which turned England into what she is today, never quite 
reached Lancashire, or, if it did, it did so gently and reasonably, in 
the peaceful infiltrations of the more tolerant periods that followed 
the bloody impositions of the Tudors. The kind of Protestantism that 
flourished in the time of Cromwell and bred a new race of bourgeois 
merchants was Calvinistic. Predestination was its doctrinal core. Man 
could not will his salvation; his future state had been predetermined by
 God.</p><p>Catholicism rejects a doctrine that seems to send some men 
arbitrarily to Heaven, others—quite as arbitrarily—to Hell. Your future 
destination, says Catholic theology, is in your hands. There is nothing 
to prevent you from sinning, if you wish to sin; at the same time, there
 is nothing to prevent your approaching the channels of divine grace 
that will secure your salvation. The fact that the two opposed 
doctrines—that of free will and that of predestination—are able to 
subsist in the same religious faith needs some explaining. There is, to 
start with, the fact of God’s omniscience. If God knows everything, He 
knows whether I am going to be damned or saved: my ultimate abode has, 
so to speak, been reserved from the very beginning of time. But if God 
gives man the power of free choice He may be thought of as deliberately 
withholding from Himself His awareness of what man is going to do with 
that power. An omniscient and omnipotent God, as a gesture of love for 
man, limits both His own power and His own knowledge.</p><p>Sean 
O’Faolain, in his autobiography, records an inability to reconcile man’s
 free will with God’s total knowledge which was resolved—in a sudden 
magical or miraculous flash of insight—one day before a taxi ride in 
Manhattan. O’Faolain put it to himself this way: Any action of man 
remained a free action until it was performed. Once performed, it became
 something God had willed. He and the taxi-driver got drunk on this 
discovery.</p><p>But the Calvinists have always had a very heavy piece 
of artillery with which to support their predestination campaign. At the
 free-will army they aim the cannon of the Fall. Adam fell through the 
primal sin of disobedience; he transmitted to all his descendants the 
guilt of that sin. Men are predisposed to sin; they are not free 
creatures. The orthodox reply to that is, of course, that Christ died to
 make men free, but Calvinism seems singularly unelated by this fact. 
The theocracies built by Calvinists, city-states or whole commonwealths 
ruled by self-elected holy men, have always been characterized by a kind
 of wet-weather gloom. Look at Cotton Mather’s Massachusetts, the Geneva
 of John Calvin himself. To them, it was a mark of Catholic depravity to
 let men work out their own destinies. Men are sinful, men will not 
avoid sin (why should they, since they are predestined to Hell or Heaven
 whatever they do?), men must be made to be good. And, even more so, 
women, daughters of treacherous Eve. Calvinism is full of negative 
reinforcements.</p><p>It is not my aim to teach elementary theology 
here, and it is certainly not my intention to view the contemporary 
world from an angle of inherited faith. I am merely concerned with 
showing that certain terms we borrow from theology have validity in a 
secular approach to our problems. Being a person in whom religious faith
 has been shaky for forty years, it would be hypocritical if I preached 
that, to stop war and regenerate the polluted rivers, we should get back
 to God. What I do suggest is that religion, and such secular or 
anthropocentric disciplines as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, 
have something in common, and that is an awareness of the abiding fact 
of man’s unhappiness. And it would seem that certain words of ancient 
provenance—like “good,” “evil,” “free will,” even “original sin”—do not 
have to be superseded by pseudo-scientific terminology just because they
 happen to derive from a God-centered approach to man.</p><figure><p><span></span></p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a16575&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a16575" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Angelo tells us you haven’t been laughing.”</span></p></div><p></p></figure><p>“We
 called the chess-board white,—we call it black,” says Bishop Blougram 
in Robert Browning’s poem. In other words, an optimistic view of human 
life is as valid as a pessimistic one. But whose life do we mean—that of
 the entire race or that of the inconspicuous fragment of it each of us 
calls “myself”? I think I am optimistic about man: I think his race will
 survive, I think—however slowly or painfully—he will solve his major 
problems just because he is aware of them. As for myself, all I can say 
is that I am growing old, my sight is blurring, my teeth always need 
attention, I cannot eat or drink as much as I once did, I am more and 
more frequently bored. I cannot remember names, my reason works slowly, I
 have spasms of envy of the young and of resentment at my own imminent 
decay. If I had a burning faith in personal survival, this gloom of 
senescence might be greatly mitigated. But I have lost this faith and am
 unlikely to recover it. Sometimes I have a desire for immediate 
annihilation, but the urge to remain alive always supervenes. There are 
consolations—love, literature, music, the colorful life of the southern 
city in which I spend much of my time—but these are very fitful. There 
is a bigger and more abiding consolation—the fact that I am free to 
write what I wish, that I have to follow no clock, that I need call no 
man “sir” and defer to him through fear. But such freedom breeds its own
 compunctions: I feel guilty if I do not work; I am my own tyrant. The 
things I have now I needed most when I was young. I remember Goethe’s 
dictum: “Beware of wishing for anything in youth, because you will get 
it in middle age.”</p><p>I recognize that I am better off than most, but
 I do not regard myself as having opted out of the agony and anxiety 
that plague men and women who are slaves to lives they did not choose 
and denizens of communities they hate. I think especially of the 
citizens of great industrial and commercial towns—New York, London, 
Bombay, my own Manchester. “In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou earn 
bread”: the Book of Genesis says it best. The maintenance of a complex 
society depends increasingly on routine work, work with no zest or 
creativity. The things we eat, clothes we wear, places where we live 
become increasingly standardized, because standardization is the price 
we pay for the prices we are able to pay. Life ticks along for most of 
us like a Woolworth’s alarm clock. We grow used to the rhythm imposed on
 us by our need to subsist: soon we get to like our bondage.</p><p>One 
of the slogans of George Orwell’s superstate in “1984” is “Freedom is 
slavery.” This can be taken to mean that the burden of making one’s own 
choices is, for many people, intolerable. To be tied to the necessity of
 deciding for oneself is to be a slave to one’s will. I remember when, 
at the age of twenty-two, I joined the British Army. At first I resented
 the discipline, the removal of even minimal liberty (such as the right 
to eat when and what one chose, the right to go to the toilet when one’s
 bowels, and not the bugle, dictated). Soon my reduction to a piece of 
clockwork began to please me, soothe me. One of a squad, obeying orders 
with the whole squad, forbidden to ask questions or to question orders—I
 was, after four years of rigorous academic life, having a delicious 
vacation from the need to be <em>choosing</em> all the time. I can, 
after six years of that, sympathize with the civilian who is unhappy 
about making his own decisions—where to eat, whom to vote for, what to 
wear. It is easier to be <em>told:</em> smoke Hale—ninety per cent less 
tar; read this novel, seventy-five weeks on the best-seller list; don’t 
see that movie, it’s artsy-shmartsy.</p><p>Perhaps there is something to
 be said for conformity in social life when our working lives have so 
little room for rugged individualism: it is painful to be an expert on 
Spinoza in the evenings and a machine operative for the rest of the day.
 And there is something in our gregarious makeup which makes us want to 
conform. Even rebels against conformity find a conformity of their 
own—the uniform of long hair, beard, chinos, beads or amulet, for 
instance, the invariable taste for pot and protest songs on the guitar. A
 man has to conform to a pattern of work in order to feed himself and 
his family; a man may find it pleasurable or natural or convenient to 
conform in his social tastes. But when patterns of conformity are 
imposed by the state, then one has a right to be frightened. 
Unfortunately, the political conformity which leads to a colored 
uniform, a flag, a slogan, a muzzle on free speech tends to work on a 
willingness to conform in nonpolitical areas.</p><p>We probably have no 
duty to like Beethoven or hate Coca-Cola, but it is at least conceivable
 that we have a duty to distrust the state. Thoreau wrote of the duty of
 civil disobedience; Whitman said, “Resist much, obey little.” With 
those liberals, and with many others, disobedience is a good thing in 
itself. In small social entities—English parishes, Swiss cantons—the 
machine that governs can sometimes be identified with the community that
 is governed. But when the social entity grows large, becomes a 
megalopolis, a state, a federation, the governing machine becomes 
remote, impersonal, even inhuman. It takes money from us for purposes we
 do not seem to sanction; it treats us as abstract statistics; it 
controls an army; it supports a police force whose function does not 
always appear to be protective.</p><p>This, of course, is a 
generalization that may be regarded as prejudiced nonsense. I personally
 do not trust politicians or statesmen—very few writers and artists 
do—and consider that men enter politics for the negative reason that 
they have little talent for anything else and the positive reason that 
power is always delicious. Against this must be set the truth that 
government makes healthful laws to protect the community and, in the 
great international world, can be the voice of our traditions and 
aspirations. But the fact remains that, in our own century, the state 
has been responsible for most of our nightmares. No single individual or
 free association of individuals could have achieved the repressive 
techniques of Nazi Germany, the slaughter of intensive bombing, or the 
atomic bomb. War departments can think in terms of megadeaths, while it 
is as much as the average man can do to entertain dreams of killing the 
boss. The modern state, whether in a totalitarian or a democratic 
country, has far too much power, and we are probably right to fear it.</p><p>It
 is significant that the nightmare books of our age have not been about 
new Draculas and Frankensteins but about what may be termed 
dystopias—inverted utopias, in which an imagined megalithic government 
brings human life to an exquisite pitch of misery. Sinclair Lewis, in 
“It Can’t Happen Here”—a novel curiously neglected—presents an America 
that becomes fascist, and the quality of the fascism is as American as 
apple pie. The wisecracking homespun Will Rogers-like President uses the
 provisions of a constitution created by Jeffersonian optimists to 
create a despotism which, to the unthinking majority, at first looks 
like plain common sense. The trouncing of long-haired intellectuals and 
shrill anarchists always appeals to the average man, although it may 
really mean the suppression of liberal thought (the American 
Constitution was the work of long-haired intellectuals) and the 
elimination of political dissidence. Orwell’s “1984”—a nightmare vision 
which may conceivably have prevented the nightmare fact from being 
realized: no one expects the real 1984 to be like Orwell’s—shows the 
unabashed love of power and cruelty which too many political leaders 
have hidden under the flowers of “inspirational” rhetoric. The “Inner 
Party” of Orwell’s future England exerts control over the population 
through the falsification of the past, so that no one can appeal to a 
dead tradition of freedom; through the delimitation of language, so that
 treasonable thoughts cannot be formulated; through a “doublethink” 
epistemology, which makes the outside world appear as the rulers wish it
 to appear; and through simple torture and brainwashing.</p><p>Both the 
American and the British visions conjoin in assuming that the aversive 
devices of fear and torture are the inevitable techniques of despotism, 
which seeks total control over the individual. But, as long ago as 1932,
 Aldous Huxley, in his “Brave New World,” demonstrated the submissive 
docility that powerful states seek from their subjects as being more 
easily obtainable through non-aversive techniques. Pre-natal and 
infantile conditioning makes the slaves happy in their slavery, and 
stability is enforced not through whips but through a scientifically 
imposed contentment. Here, of course, is a way that man may take if he 
really desires a world in which there are no wars, no population crises,
 no Dostoyevskian agonies. The conditioning techniques are available, 
and perhaps the state of the world may soon frighten man into accepting 
them. But, so Huxley states through his hero, an uncivilized savage 
brought up on an Indian reservation, happiness is not really what we 
want. Man is, almost by definition, a restless creature—creative, 
destructive, given to elation and pain. The young savage demands what 
the brave new world cannot give—unhappiness—and so he kills himself.</p><p>“Man,”
 said G. K. Chesterton, “is a woman”—he does not know what he wants. 
There are few of us who do not reject outright both the Orwellian and 
the Huxleian nightmares. In a sense, we would prefer the repressive 
society, full of secret police and barbed wire, to the scientifically 
conditioned one, in which being happy means doing the right thing. All 
of us might agree with Professor Skinner that a well-run, conditioned 
society is an excellent thing for a new race—a breed of men rationally 
convinced of the need to be conditioned, so long as the conditioning is 
based on rewards and not punishment. But we are not the new race, and we
 stubbornly do not want to be anything but what we are—creatures aware 
of our faults and determined, more or less, to do something about those 
faults in our own way. We may even think in terms of two kinds of human 
being—ourselves, free men or imperfect men, and the new men yet to be 
made (man’s own creation, not nature’s), whom we might perhaps call 
neoanthrops, a coinage which sounds like strangulation. To christen a 
being of the new, or Skinnerian, age a newman might be inappropriate: 
the great English cardinal would turn in his grave.</p><p>Curiously, or 
perhaps not, the figures in history we most revere are those men and 
women who fought against repression and were even martyred for upholding
 the right or the good. Prometheus, Socrates, Jesus Christ, Sir Thomas 
More, Giordano Bruno, Galileo—the list is extensive, and history goes on
 adding to it with heroes like the Kennedys and Martin Luther King, Jr. 
It is as though we perversely need intolerance because we cannot do 
without heroes. What the great intransigents do for us is remind us of 
certain absolutes, like good and evil. It was the Nazi occupation of 
France that made Jean-Paul Sartre formulate a new philosophy of man 
which sounds, though it is not, like a theology. Speaking of that “age 
of assassins” foretold by Rimbaud, Sartre (in his “What Is Literature?”)
 says:</p><blockquote><p>We have been taught to take [evil] seriously. 
It is neither our fault nor our merit if we lived in a time when torture
 was a daily fact. Châteaubriand, Oradour, the Rue des Saussaies, Dachau
 and Auschwitz have all demonstrated to us that Evil is not an 
appearance, that knowing its cause does not dispel it, that it is not 
opposed to Good as a confused idea is to a clear 
one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In spite of ourselves, we come to this 
conclusion, which will seem shocking to lofty souls: Evil cannot be 
redeemed.</p></blockquote><p>The stale, tired, corrupt period of the 
nineteen-thirties in France represented a kind of clockwork condition, a
 zestless ticking of the human machine. When Frenchmen were least free, 
under the occupation, then, by a paradox typically human, they were at 
last free to recover a sense of the dignity of human freedom. There was 
the Resistance; there was the final and irreducible freedom to say no to
 evil. This is a right not available in a society concerned with 
reinforcing behavior. That a man may be willing to suffer torture and 
death for the sake of a principle is a kind of mad perversity that makes
 little sense in the behaviorist’s laboratory.</p><p>We all tend to use 
the term “evil” without being willing to define it. It is not quite a 
synonym for “bad,” since we cannot talk of an evil orange, except 
poetically, or an evil performance of the violin. It is certainly not a 
synonym for “wrong.” “Right” and “wrong,” we recognize, are terms with 
variable referents—in other words, what is right at one time can be 
wrong at another. In a period of war against Germany, it can be so wrong
 to be friendly with Germans that you may be shot for it; in a period of
 peace, it can be right to be friendly with them, or at least a matter 
of neutral import. It is right to obey whatever laws are in force at a 
given time, and wrong to deliberately flout them. We cannot take right 
and wrong very seriously, since they shift and waver so much. We need 
absolute terms like “good” and “evil.” Our attitude toward good is 
curiously noncommittal or halfhearted; we are more used to being told 
not to commit evil than exhorted to do good.</p></div></div></div>
